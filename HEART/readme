A simple yet effective web application built using Streamlit and Machine Learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on user input. The model was trained on clinical features and uses a Decision Tree (or similar model) for binary classification.

🧪 Features

Predicts high or low risk of heart disease

User-friendly input interface for medical features

Uses a trained ML model with proper feature scaling

Real-time predictions directly in your browser

Encoded clinical inputs for accurate modeling

🚀 Demo

Click the “Predict” button after entering your values to see your risk level (High or Low).Prediction is based on features such as age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and more.
